# TestCase Service Refactoring

## Overview
Refactored the monolithic `TestCaseService` (437 lines) into multiple specialized services to improve maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.

## Service Architecture

### Main Service
- **TestCaseService**: Orchestrator service that delegates operations to specialized services

### Specialized Services
1. **TestCaseCrudService**: Handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. **TestCaseAIService**: Handles AI-related operations (generation, integration with AI service)
3. **TestCaseSearchService**: Handles semantic search operations
4. **TestCaseReferenceService**: Handles reference management (derived test cases, manual references)
5. **TestCaseEmbeddingService**: Handles embedding generation

## File Structure
```

```

## Dependency Injection
- Uses interface-based dependency injection for better testability
- Each service implements its corresponding interface
- Services are registered with string tokens in the module
- Main service uses `@Inject()` decorator to inject specialized services

## Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single responsibility
2. **Improved Testability**: Services can be mocked individually
3. **Better Maintainability**: Smaller, focused code files
4. **Easier Onboarding**: Clear service boundaries
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Each service handles specific domain logic

## Interface Definitions
- `ITestCaseCrudService`: CRUD operations interface
- `ITestCaseAIService`: AI operations interface
- `ITestCaseSearchService`: Search operations interface
- `ITestCaseReferenceService`: Reference management interface
- `ITestCaseEmbeddingService`: Embedding generation interface

## Module Configuration
The module registers all services with their interfaces:
```typescript
providers: [
  {
    provide: 'ITestCaseCrudService',
    useClass: TestCaseCrudService,
  },
  // ... other services
]
```

## Migration Notes
- All existing API endpoints remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to client applications
- Internal service architecture improved without affecting external interface
- All business logic preserved and properly separated

## Next Steps
1. Add unit tests for each specialized service
2. Consider extracting common patterns into base classes
3. Add logging and monitoring for each service
4. Consider adding service-specific validation logic
